/**
 * Default interface for comment user notification object types with notifications
 * being sent to multiple recipients.
 * 
 * This interface can also be implemented by user notification object types for
 * comment responses. In this case, there is no distinction between commentResponse
 * and commentResponseOwner event and only a commentResponse event is fired.
 * 
 * Since version 5.2 it is possible to send an `commentResponseOwner` notification 
 * even if you implement this interface. Simple add the interface 
 * `IMultiRecipientCommentResponseOwnerUserNotificationObjectType`, too.
